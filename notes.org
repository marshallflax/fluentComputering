* Introduction
Computer programming, done well, is essentially a collaborative activity.  Sometimes you will collaborate with your colleagues, but you will also always be collaborating with the computer itself.  The objective of this guide is to help non-programmers learn to collaborate well with their computers, which is an act commonly known as "computer programming".

Decades ago, the interfaces provided by computers were bare and rigid.  The code written by a programmer consisted of a series of barked orders: "add 2 to this thing!", "display that thing!", "if that other thing is equal to zero, then go to step number 23!".  This drill-sergeant approach to computing does allow computers to do just about anything that a computer can do, but it isn't exactly a happy approach.  But more importantly, this "imperative" style requires that the commands be precisely thought-out by the programmer -- the slightest omission (or unconsidered scenario), and suddenly we have a "bug".
